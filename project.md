# world-of-cards
still placeholder named
it's a roguelike with rpg elements

- The world is made of cards; face-down cards represent unexplored areas.
- The player earns cards that define the actions they can perform.
- The player flips world cards face-up to see what happens—what kind of adventure, what kind of world this is.
- Some cards on the table are a natural biome, some are villages, dungeons etc
- The player explores the world by playing action cards in the game.
- They perform actions, go on adventures, fight monsters.
- Progress is incremental—exploring more and earning more points over time.
- Heavy focus on the logic/programming of each card, relying on procedural generation for the world and the adventures.
- The game ends when the player dies anyhow (battle, hunger, aging)

## unexplored ideas

_generations_ i thought that was a little brilliant. 
the player having children and in a next game+, 
they could play in the same world but with a different character 

## aging 

have actions take time
with the passage of time, player gets old
